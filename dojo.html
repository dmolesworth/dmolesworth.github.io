                    <h2 id="overview">Problem space</h2>
                    <p>The existing rate review process was highly manual and time-intensive. On average, customer service agents (CSAs) spent approximately 43 minutes on the phone navigating multiple spreadsheets to complete a rate review with a customer. This constituted 18% of all customer contact at Dojo.</p>
                    <blockquote>Customer frustrations about long phone times were consistently highlighted during discovery interviews with customer service agents (CSAs), further emphasising the need for improvement.</blockquote>

                    </div>
                    <h2 id="">Discovery & focus areas</h2>
                    <p>We began with a kickoff discovery workshop involving stakeholders from customer service, product, and engineering.</p>
                    <div style="width: 90vw;margin-left: -45vw;" class="img-bg">
                            <img alt="User flow with post it notes as a result of workshop exercise with product, customer service and engineering.

                    </div>
                    <p>Insights from this workshop, combined with further discovery and call data analysis, helped us prioritise focus areas in the rate review process. We identified two main areas for improvement:</p>
                    <div class="row"> <strong>Finding the best rates:</strong> The process of determining optimal rates for both customers and the business was cumbersome and inefficient. Advisors had to navigate multiple spreadsheets/systems, which added unnecessary complexity and negatively impacted the user experience. Our <strong>Hypothesis</strong> was that if we can simplify the the process of reviewing a customers rates, we'll reduce call time and improve eNPS.
                    </div>
                    <div class="row"> <strong>Note taking after the call:</strong> Advisors spent, on average, 45% of their time manually summarising calls. This resulted in inconsistent notes, ranging from extensive detail to minimal information and confusion and inefficiency in understanding prior interactions. Our <strong>Hypothesis</strong> was that if we can simplify the process of manually taking notes, we'd reduce the overall handling time of tickets 
                    </div>
                    <h2 id="">Prototyping & testing</h2>
                    <p>To improve the process of <strong>finding the best rates</strong>, we conducted weekly discovery sessions with CSAs to validate hypotheses and gather feedback on prototypes. Key findings included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Advisors struggled to digest the large amounts of data presented.</li>
                        <li>Advisors often relied on zooming and keyboard shortcuts in spreadsheets, highlighting the importance of this functionality in the tool.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We focused on improving usability by addressing these points.</p>
                    <div class="img-bg">
                    <div class="img-detail-2">
                        <img src="images/zoom.png" />
                        <p>We ensured the data table was easily navigatable using keyboard input for increased usability when moving between different rates.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="img-detail-2">
                        <img src="images/focus.png" />
                        <p>We added tabs to break up the rates and fees into categories instead of one long list, adding 'High impact' rates in one place meant CSAs could see where the customer was being charged the most.</p>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>We focused on other feature enhancements to ensure the CSA could easily find the best rates and explain the impact to the customer;</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Introduced rate 'packages' that featured pre-populated rates for CSAs to choose from which helped <strong>reduce cognitive load.</strong></li>
                        <li>Displayed the impact of the rate change across invoices and per location which made it <strong>easier to explain savings to the customer.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="img-bg">

                        <img src="images/acrosslocation.png" />
                        <p>Savings across locations.</p>

                        <p>Rate plan packages.</p>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>We launched the first iteration of the tool to a small group of beta testers before rolling it out to the entire contact centre.</p>
                    <blockquote>Part of our initial discovery and rollout research was to sit in on calls with customers to observe CSAs using the tool in a real setting.</blockquote>
                    <div class="img-bg">

                    </div>
                    </div>
                     <h2 id="">Challenges</h2>
                     <p>Rate plan packages were not used as expected, CSAs would often start with a custom plan because every customer is different and packages were too rigid.</p>
                     <hr/>
                    <h2 id="">Introducing AI Call Summaries</h2>
                    <p>To tackle the note-taking problem, <strong>we explored leveraging AI to automate call summaries.</strong> We began by designing various summary formats, experimenting with combinations of headings, bold text, bullet points, and paragraphs to make the summaries clear and structured. These formats were tested with CSAs to identify the most effective approach.</p>
                    <p><img style="box-shadow: none;" src="images/before.png" /></p>
                    <p><img style="box-shadow: none;" src="images/after.png" /></p>

                    <h2 id="">Implementation</h2>
                    <p>Using a large language model (LLM), we iterated on prompts to achieve the desired summary structure. Initially, we <strong>released this feature to 15 beta testers for feedback.</strong> Early issues included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Misidentification of callers (e.g., distinguishing between customers and Payment Consultants).</li>
                        <li>Errors in numerical values.</li>
                        <li>Fabricated call endings when calls were dropped.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To address these issues, we:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refined prompts to clearly specify transcription boundaries.</li>
                        <li>Established a quality testing team to review random samples and ensure accuracy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Advisors were initially sceptical of the summaries and waited to review them, negating the time-saving benefits.</strong> Advocates within the contact centre helped promote trust in the tool but this also led us to enhance the feature to allow advisors to edit the summary before it was sent to Zendesk.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The modal below would appear as an overlay on the screen once the call with the customer had ended.</li>
                        <li>CSAs were able to edit the AI call summarisation before it was posted on the ticket in Zendesk. It allowed the CSA to add any detail the AI might have missed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="img-bg">
                        <div class="img-detail-2">

                    <h2 id="">Learnings & Challenges</h2>
                    <p><strong>AI as an Assistant, Not a Replacement:</strong> Human intervention was still necessary when the LLM produced incorrect summaries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Behavioural changes:</strong> CSAs flagged missing details but accepted that the AI captured the most critical aspects of calls. However, some advisors adjusted their speech to ensure certain points were included in the summary.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <h2 id="">Impact</h2>
                    <div class="row">Reduction in call time of 33% (14 mins)</div>
                    <div class="row">eNPS score of +80</div>
                    <p>As well as tracking quantative metrics around call time, we also gathered qualatative data in the form of follow up interviews and a survey(employee NPS) before and after the feature roll out to ensure there was no negative impact to their experience.</p>
                    <blockquote>“this makes life so much easier for people like me who have ADHD and struggle with quick processing when reading/writing”</blockquote>
                    <p>The simplification of reviewing a customer's rates, plus the removal of the need to take notes allowed advisors to be present with our customers. Using active listening means they can help a customer much faster and respond better.</p>
