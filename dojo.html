                    </div>
                    <h2 id="overview">Problem space</h2>
                    <p>The existing rate review process was highly manual and time-intensive. On average, customer service agents (CSAs) spent approximately <strong>43 minutes on the phone, navigating multiple spreadsheets</strong> to complete a rate review with a customer. This constituted 18% of all customer contact at Dojo.</p>
                    <blockquote>Customer frustrations about long phone times were consistently highlighted during discovery interviews with customer service agents (CSAs), further emphasising the need for improvement.</blockquote>

                    </div>
                    <p><strong>The service blueprint exercise highlighted</strong> the friction created when advisors were navigating many systems trying to provide the customer with better rates.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="">Building empathy</h2>
                    <p>Advisor job satisfaction is extremely important to us. We want to ensure the tools they use are streamlined & easy to use so that they instantly <strong>feel comfortable when on the phone with customers.</strong> This helps them serve our customers quickly & efficiently. To achieve this, we run a continuous discovery initiative in the support center, dedicating time each week to one-on-one and group sessions with CSAs to uncover problems and test ideas.</p>
                    <h2 id="">Discovery & focus areas</h2>
                    <p>We began with a kickoff discovery workshop involving stakeholders from customer service, product, and engineering. I used insights from initial discovery interviews to map out the processes involved with completing a rate review, asking participants to note down any pain points they had framed by a How Might We statement.</p>
                    <p><strong>How might we maximise efficiency when actioning a Rate Reviews, reducing Call-Time and maximising NPS/CSAT and eNPS.</strong></p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Insights from this workshop, combined with further discovery and call data analysis, helped us prioritise focus areas in the rate review process. We identified two main areas for improvement:</p>
                    <div class="row"> <strong>Finding the best rates:</strong> The process of determining optimal rates for both customers and the business was cumbersome and inefficient. Advisors had to navigate multiple spreadsheets/systems, which added unnecessary complexity and negatively impacted the user experience. <br/><strong>Our hypothesis</strong> was that if we can simplify the the process of reviewing a customers rates, we'll reduce call time and improve eNPS.
                    </div>
                    <div class="row"> <strong>Note taking after the call:</strong> Advisors spent, on average, 45% of their time manually summarising calls. This resulted in inconsistent notes, ranging from extensive detail to minimal information and confusion and inefficiency in understanding prior interactions.<br/><strong>Our Hypothesis</strong> was that if we can simplify the process of manually taking notes, we'd reduce the overall handling time of tickets 
                    </div>
                    <h2>Early testing</h2>
                    <p>Once we gathered the requirements for the data to be displayed, I experimented with various page layouts and table designs to present the datasets effectively. We wanted to ensure users could quickly understand the data, enabling them to make timely rate amendment recommendations to the customer.</p>

                        <p>Experimenting with different way data could be shown and hidden to reduce noise.</p>

                    <h2 id="">Iterations</h2>
                    <p>To improve the process of <strong>finding the best rates</strong>, we conducted weekly discovery sessions with CSAs to validate hypotheses and gather feedback on prototypes. Key findings included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Advisors struggled to digest the large amounts of data presented.</strong> So we introduced a tabbed layout to prioritize the most critical rate data upfront, reducing visual clutter and introducing better hierarchy for easier scanning.</li>
                        <li>Advisors often relied on <strong>zooming and keyboard shortcuts</strong> in spreadsheets, highlighting the importance of this functionality in the tool.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="img-bg">
                    <div class="img-detail-2">
                        <img style="box-shadow:none;" src="images/focus.png" />
                        <p>We ensured the data table was easily navigatable using keyboard input for increased usability when moving between different rates.</p>

                        <img style="box-shadow:none;" src="images/zoom.png" />
                        <p>We added tabs to break up the rates and fees into categories instead of one long list, adding 'High impact' rates in one place meant CSAs could see where the customer was being charged the most.</p>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>We focused on other feature enhancements to ensure the CSA could easily find the best rates and explain the impact to the customer;</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Introduced rate 'packages' that featured pre-populated rates for CSAs to choose from which helped <strong>reduce cognitive load.</strong></li>
                        <li>Displayed the impact of the rate change across invoices and per location which made it <strong>easier to explain savings to the customer.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="img-bg">

                        <p>Savings across locations to speed up explaining savings.</p>

                        <p>Rate plan packages to make finding the best rates quicker.</p>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <h2 id="">Challenges</h2>
                     <p><strong>Rate plan packages were not used as expected,</strong> CSAs would often start with a custom plan because every customer is different and packages were too rigid. We decided to roll out an update to disable the package functionality, allowing CSAs to start with a completely custom plan, which also reduced the amount of noise on the page.</p>
                     <h2>Feature refinement</h2>
                    <p>During our initial discovery activities, <strong>we identified friction in the process of getting approval from a manager</strong> for particularly low rates. This was another area of functionality we focused on to make time saving efficiencies.</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>The CSA would be alerted when the rates they suggested needed approving by a manager and would be prompted to send a link to their rate plan to a manager</li>
                        <li>The manager could view the rates in real time and approve them to allow the CSA to lower the rates for the customer.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="img-bg">
                        <div>

                    <h2 id="">Beta release</h2>
                    <p>We launched the first iteration of the tool to a small group of beta testers before rolling it out to the entire contact centre.</p>
                    <blockquote>Part of our initial discovery and rollout research was to sit in on calls with customers to observe CSAs using the tool in a real setting. This allowed us to address points of friction quicker and with more confidence.</blockquote>
                     <p>We released the rate review tool in different stages in order to deliver value to our users and the business more quickly. <strong>The below image shows the first full release of the tool;</strong></p>

                    <h2 id="">Introducing AI Call Summaries</h2>
                    <p>To tackle the note-taking problem, <strong>we explored leveraging AI to automate call summaries.</strong> We began by designing various summary formats, experimenting with combinations of headings, bold text, bullet points, and paragraphs to make the summaries clear and structured. These formats were tested with CSAs to identify the most effective approach.</p>
                    <p><img style="box-shadow: none;" src="images/before.png" /></p>

                    <h2 id="">Implementation</h2>
                    <p>Using a large language model (LLM), we iterated on prompts to achieve the desired summary structure. Initially, we <strong>released this feature to 15 beta testers for feedback.</strong> Early issues included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Misidentification of callers (e.g., distinguishing between customers and Payment Consultants).</li>
                        <li>Errors in numerical values.</li>
                        <li>Fabricated call endings when calls were dropped.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To address these issues, we:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refined prompts to clearly specify transcription boundaries.</li>
                        <li>Established a quality testing team to review random samples and ensure accuracy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Below is an example of the call summary that was automatically sent to the Zendesk ticket;</p>
                    <p><img style="box-shadow: none;" src="images/after.png" /></p>
                    <h2 id="">Iterating</h2>
                    <p>Advocates within the contact centre helped promote trust in the tool but advisors were sceptical of the summaries and waited to review them in Zendesk, negating the time-saving benefits.</p>  
                    <strong>Iteration</strong>
                        <p>This led us to enhance the feature to allow advisors to edit the summary before it was sent to Zendesk.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The modal below would appear as an overlay on the screen once the call with the customer had ended.</li>
                        <li>CSAs were able to edit the AI call summarisation before it was posted on the ticket in Zendesk. It allowed the CSA to add any detail the AI might have missed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Outcome</strong>
                    <p>Adoption increased as CSAs gained confidence in the AI summaries.</p>
                    <div class="img-bg">
                    <div style="padding: 32px 32px 0px 32px;" class="img-detail-1">

                    </div>
                    </div>
                     <p>Once the call had ended, the AI summary appeared in an dialogue overlay → The CSA was then given the opportunity to edit the summary → The summary could then be submitted to the Zendesk ticket</p>
                    <h2 id="">Learnings & Challenges</h2>
                    <p><strong>AI as an Assistant, Not a Replacement:</strong> Human intervention was still necessary when the LLM produced incorrect summaries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Behavioural changes:</strong> CSAs flagged missing details but accepted that the AI captured the most critical aspects of calls. However, some advisors adjusted their speech to ensure certain points were included in the summary.</p>
                    <hr/>

                    <p><strong>Scalability:</strong> Our current UK growth rate, combined with our international expansion plans, could potentially harm our customer experience. Relying predominantly on phone-based customer contact (currently 80%) isn't efficient or scalable and may lead to exponential increases in the cost to serve.</p>
                    <p><strong>Customer Experience:</strong> It's essential to ensure that our product/feature offerings, including our support and education services, align with the cost of our service for customers; this requires creating support and education offerings that not only match but surpass our competitors</p>
                    <p><strong>Activating in-app self-serve:</strong> To activate customers preferred channels of support including both self-serve and help, leading to an increase in queries resolved without the need for human intervention.</p>
